# Star Wars Simulator
## Description:
The Star Wars simulator project was developed in Python as a hobby project, aiming to create a simulation of space battles inspired by the Star Wars universe. Unlike traditional simulations, this simulator introduces an element of realism by incorporating variability in the firepower of the involved units. Each unit fires with a different strength, resulting in different outcomes for each battle, even with the same units involved.

## Technologies Used:
- Language: Python.
## Features:
- Variable Firepower: Units in the simulator have varying firepower, leading to unpredictable outcomes for each battle.
- Input Files: Data regarding the size of fleets to be engaged in battle is provided in flota_1.txt and flota_2.txt.
- Battle Phases: The simulator displays different phases of the battle and updates unit losses after each phase.
